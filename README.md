# GQuant

A Simple Event-driven Backtester for futures market with Python 3.x

Note: GQuant is a simple backtesting frame for Chinese Futures Market. Personally speaking, it's a efficient tool or project to understand the key idea of event-driven programming model and object-oriented programming with Python, and their application on quantitative development/financial computing.
