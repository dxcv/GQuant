# GQuant

A Simple Event-driven Backtester for futures market with Python 3.x

Note: GQuant is a simple backtesting frame for Chinese Futures Market. Personally speaking, it's a efficient tool or project to understand the key idea of event-driven programming model and object-oriented programming with Python, and their application on quantitative development/financial computing. 

Furthermore, there are many space for improvement, such as 

- More dedicated designed exchange simulator. It is flexible and extendible, for day/hour/minute/second/tick level data executor. Even you can make it for order book dynamics research.
- Maybe you's like to link with CTP or SimNow, and it's OKay.
- More accurate commission model for different financial trading underlying and  different markets. 
- More precise slippage model for different liqudity environment.

## Environment：

- Python >= 3.5
